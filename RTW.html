	<p class="intro">According to an article of MasterClass Website, they defined RTW as Ready-to-wear,it is a clothing that is sold "off the rack" is made in uniform sizes, is typically mass-produced, and is intended to be purchased and worn immediately, sometimes without modification. Just to give you a brief history of this type of clothing business, in addition to the MasterClass article about RTW clothes, during the War of 1812, the US government began mass-producing military uniforms, making them one of the first ready-to-wear garments in history. The concept of ready-to-wear menâ€™s clothing survived the war, and by the end of the century, most men had access to ready-to-wear clothing lines in department stores. Moreover, Yves Saint Lauren is the one who opened up his first store selling a ready-to-wear line by the late 1960s.

			Just like any other clothing business, RTW is also a part of the trend now when it comes to clothing line business. What makes it different from the other type of clothing business is that RTW are much more likely to be more convenient than the other because that's the main idea of this kind of business, to provide comfy and convenient clothing to its customer. It might be similar to haute couture but it is not, haute couture is  a high-end clothing that is made or tailored exclusively for specific wearer. 

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				<li class="title">Find your Business Niche</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">You have to come up first with your business plan so that even where the business will take, you'll not lose on track. Before everything else, you first have to come up with a good business plan, know the trends and your markets, also your competitors, your budget and your dedication to pursue the business you are aiming for. Make sure that your business has a unique identity from others and you have to plan it carefully before jumping into.</p>
					

				<li class="title">Be Creative and Unique.</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">As part of the planning process, you should be much more creative and unique. People would find it more difficult to know your business identity if it is something just like the other clothing business, meaning to say that you have to build your own business identity and being unique and creative enough would be a great help. You should also consider the trends in able for your business to cope up with it. Having this advantage of yours can also help you to produce the best branding of the clothes you are going to provide and sell. In this phase will include choosing your business name, designing your clothes to sell, and other basic works to be done in starting your business.</p>

				

				<li class="title">Choose the right supplier and manufacturer</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">If you want to be a reseller of this kind of business, you should always consider first to choose the right supplier of yours. But if you want to establish one, both of the two should be considered, this is also one of the most crucial and important parts in the planning process. The business would probably depend on them, if both of them can't provide a proper transaction that causes delay and any product issues that leads to customers dissatisfaction, the business would eventually fail.</p>

				<li class="title">Build your Budget </li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Aside from planning the brand of your product, name of your business, choosing your supplier and manufacturer, the phase of budget planning is also important to come first as well. In this type of clothing line business, it might be a little expensive, it requires production that is usually done by manufacturers and by this it would cost you a lot. Therefore, it will require enough budget to establish and operate smoothly and stably. In some articles online, for a jumpstart cost range from P25,000.00 - P30,000.00, would be considered. You have a lot of options when it comes to building your budget, but be wise enough as well. There is no assurance that a business will kick off especially in the beginning, therefore you have to really be mindful in managing your budget.</p>



				<li class="title">Start with a realist forecast</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Upon starting, you don't have to buy a large quantity of merchandise or expensive products. Focus first on the demands and productions. Make sure that the merchandise you buy for the production of your products suits enough for the demands, also the quality matters. It is much better to produce products that are just within the demands than keeping on producing that exceed customers' demands because you really have to tighten your budget in order to keep it operating.</p>

				<li class="title">Find your best location for your physical store and process legality works</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Upon planning, you must also be mindful of choosing your best location if you are going to operate also with a physical store, take note to consider choosing the place with high traffic of people . If you are planning to have that brick and mortar store, you have to be in a place where a lot of people can easily see the store and convenient to go on. Also, you have to consider first securing all the permits and licenses if you're going to pursue establishing your own physical store to avoid any problems in the long way run.</p>

				<li class="title">Choose your platform and promote your business</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">In the phase of establishing your business and making up with your marketing plans.

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

On the other hand, if you are planning to be the reseller of this business, you have to be mindful of the products that you are going to sell, since the concept is Ready-To-Wear, meaning that the product must be suitable enough for your customers. </p>

				<li class="title">Keep up with the trends</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Fashion style is not stable, maybe this is the trend now and tomorrow it's not, so you really have to always look at the trends so your business can also go with it. Having an RTW business is really hard to manage but it is always something that you would love to do despite the fast-changing fashion style. New trends meaning new ideas to know and explore for your business. According to an article online, twice a year (at least), you have to completely change the products you are selling. Products in fashion have an average of 6months of life expectancy. After these 6 months, these products lose almost all value. Youâ€™ve got to have the mindset that you need to sell your products as soon as possible.</p>

				<li class="title">Be Creative</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Always consider being creative, especially in this kind of business. Your creativeness in terms of promoting your business, designing your products, boosting your brand identity is what you always need in this business as well. As to how fast the trends go, you must also be creative enough to adapt it and make it more interesting for others.</p>

				<li class="title">Widen your markets</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">As of  now, most of the RTW business depends on the standard size of a typical size of a person so they can sell it to masses. Few RTW also customize the sizes and do not offer only on the standard sizes, but they try to produce plus-sizes which is a good thing as well to widen your markets. Don't just go on what is common, but also try to explore more about it because that will also benefit your business. </p>
