	<p class="intro">One of the key concepts of clothing line business is buy low and sell high. The wholesale/retail clothing business is no different, whether you're planning to start your own wholesale/retail clothing business store or create your own clothing line, you will find the garments industry as many-layered and diverse. Also, if you want to start a clothing business, buying wholesale is the best way to buy at the lowest price so you can decide and add your own markup, and sell for a reasonable price. Both retail and wholesale business are not so different to the others, what you really need is to find the right supplier and manufacturer. A lot of people nowadays consider trying the wholesale/retail clothing business because it is also part of the trend now. Aside from that, here in our country wholesale/retail is very popular even before the pandemic started.

		<p class="intro-business">
		<img src="wrads6.png" class="ads">
			According to some articles online, the resale industry as a whole is expected to more than double in size by 2022. Therefore the opportunity for this kind of business is expected to be more wider for the coming years and the wholesale/retail business is part of that trend. At every stage of manufacture and distribution there is usually a wholesaler who is interested in buying the produced products specifically clothes, but it is also possible to buy directly from the manufacturer which can result in a much lower cost. </p>

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				<li class="title">Work first with the business legality</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">To operate a clothing business specifically this wholesale/retail clothing business, you have to make sure that the business operates legally. As part of the planning phase, make sure to secure first all the required permits and licenses to run your business to avoid any conflicts when it is already established and operating.</p>
					

				<li class="title">Find a convenient location</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">If you're planning to settle your business outside your home, since it may really require a wide space for the stocks, you may consider having your own place where you can operate your business smoothly and efficiently. But make sure that you find the best location that is accessible enough for your potential customers. Find a place that can cater multiple loads of your stocks so it would be easy to manage.</p>

					<img src="wrads3.png" class="imagesAds">

				<li class="title">Determine your clothing niche</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">You have also to be specific about who will be your potential customers or supposed to be your target market. When you are going to sell your products as wholesale/retail, it is necessary to categorize them depending on your chosen target market especially when it is wholesaling, you cannot mix children's clothes to adult as one. You must be aware first of what type of clothes you want to sell, so you would also be specific with your supplier and retailer of your business. Moreover, if you don't have a preference, benchmarking could help you as well. You can look around your area so that you can see which market is being under-served, so you can fill that niche.</p>

		
				<li class="title">Find a right supplier and manufacturer</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Whether you are going to pursue wholesale or retail clothing business, finding the right supplier and manufacturer should be prioritized and really have to give your full attention to it. Good relationships between suppliers and wholesalers/retailers are key in this kind of business. You really have to do mindful choosing, because half of the business operation depends on them. They must be able to meet the demands of your potential customers.</p>



				<li class="title">Pricing your goods</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">According to Chris Wheatley of Scope Accounting, when pricing for wholesale, you need to look from both bottom up and top down. From the top down, as a general rule of thumb, the end retailer expects to make around 100% from the wholesaler. So you need to look at comparable products in the market, and see if youâ€™ll be able to price your wholesale products, at an attractive price for retailers.</p>

				<li class="title">Choose a right platform</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">You can sell your products in many different ways and platforms. Nowadays, most of the wholesalers/retailers clothing business usually promote their products through social media, some also trying to put their products on some online shops in order to reach wider markets. You can utilize them all, but always make sure that you can handle multiple demands from these different platforms you are planning to use. What is good today when it comes to promoting your business, is that you can really do it in a very easy way but you have to be creative enough as well to attract customers, have an effective engagement within because that can really boost your business.</p>

				<li class="title">Explore possibilities in this business</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">If the business is going well, you can explore more about the field of this business. You can also try now to find retailers that you can supply, or be open for any possible deal with regards in this. In addition, you can also try those trade shows, where you can meet representatives in person and can inspect merchandise, because it is also possible that as your business goes well and the demands get higher, also you want to follow the trend, you can have your more than one supplier. Also, be open on purchasing inventory from stores that are going out of business or that are getting rid of merchandise at the end of a season, while these items won't be on-trend, they can represent a significant profit center for your business and you can offer good deals with your customers about it that they would appreciate.</p>

			<img src="wrads8.png" class="imagesAds">
