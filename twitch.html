	<p class="intro">Twitch began as a gaming-focused spin-off of the now-defunct Justin.tv in 2011. Twitch Interactive, the parent company, was purchased by Amazon in 2014. Twitch has developed into the go-to streaming destination for esports, game streaming (not to be confused with game streaming services), and promoting other entertainment personalities since then.Twitch's presence there makes sense as well. According to hours viewed, Twitch had a 73 percent share of the live streaming network market in 2019. In terms of market share, it's down 2% from the previous year, but in terms of hours watched, it's up 20%. Even though YouTube, Facebook, and Mixer are slowly catching up, the site remains the undisputed king.</p>

		<img src="twitchads.gif" class="imagesAds">

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				<br><br>

				<li class="title">Become acquainted with the platform.</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">It's probably better to simply read through Twitch's entire legal portion. And before you create an account, you can at the very least read the group guidelines. It's also a good idea to bookmark the page because the recommendations are updated on a regular basis. In other words, you must be able to familiarize yourself first with the platform for better experience and proper usage of it.</p>

				<li class="title">Work with your PC Set-up</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">They work with a wider range of hardware, and broadcasting software includes cool features like scene creation and overlays. In reality, people who broadcast from consoles also use the consoles for gaming while broadcasting from a PC because desktop computers are so useful. When it comes to high-end streaming, PCs are inevitable, but they also have the most options when you're just getting started. One machine can be used for gaming and the other is used for encoding and streaming. Encoding should be handled by the person with the more powerful CPU.
						<br><br>
					It must be able to manage both gaming and encoding at the same time. You'll need a processor that's fairly strong. With an i5 cpu, 8 GB of RAM, and a strong internet connection, you can begin streaming. However, the more you want from your material, the more basic equipment you'll need. 

					<br><br>
					When it comes to graphics, Nvidia RTX graphics cards have hardware encoders built in, which you can use with OBS Studio to support the CPU.</p>				
					

				<li class="title">Cameras & Microphone</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">You'll need to do something else to keep your viewers entertained unless you're an elite gamer who can retain and maintain an audience simply by playing games exceptionally well. The very least you can do is have audio commentary, which allows you to express yourself and engage with your audience. It certainly beats clicking in the chat window to answer questions. Since audio quality is so essential for streamers, microphones are often a good investment. At the very least, you want people to be able to hear you clearly and understand what you're doing.</p>

					<img src="twitchads1.jpg" class="imagesAds">

				<li class="title">Create an account</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">It is always the first thing that you should do when you are planning to stream online,  you'll need a Twitch account to get started. It's as simple as pressing the "sign up" button and filling out the form on a desktop computer. The Twitch web app must be downloaded on mobile devices. Twitch suggests that you sign up with your phone number first and only add your email address later.</p>

					<!--<img src="wrads3.png" class="imagesAds"> -->

		
				<li class="title">Determine what software are you gonna use for Twitch Streaming</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Unless they have hardware encoders available, beginners should start with software encoders when broadcasting on Twitch from a desktop computer. There are many explanations for this, but they all boil down to convenience and cost.Every software encoder has its own collection of advantages and disadvantages. When making your decision, you should take a closer look at them. If you’re interested in some of the more popular options, they are:
						<br><br>
					1. <b>OBS Studio</b> — A free, open-source streaming app with cross-platform compatibility, OBS Studio is the top option for many inexperienced content creators.
						<br><br>
					2.<b> Streamlabs OBS</b> — The Streamlabs version of OBS has some great features that may help you monetize your channel. However, it is only available for Windows.
						<br><br>
					3. <b>XSplit</b> — A popular option for broadcasters who want to try out paid software before investing in the full version, it only shines if you're prepared to pay for it.
						<br><br>
					4. <b>vMix</b> — When you're ready to become a professional streamer, consider using vMix.</p>

				<li class="title">Work with your Connection & streaming settings</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Your internet does not have to be lightning fast but it does need to be decent. Make sure that your internet is fast enough to broadcast your video at 720p or more.
						<br><br>
						<img src="twitchguide.jpg" style="width: 80%; height: 220;">
						<br><br>
					Twitch's own guide is a good place to start if you're looking for hard numbers. There, you'll learn that a bitrate of around 3000 kbps is required for a simple 720p@30fps stream. This translates to about 5 Mbps upload speed, according to a list of good upload speeds for streaming.</p>

					<img src="twitchads5.png" class="imagesAds">

				<li class="title">Plan your content/ what are you going to stream</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Twitch is no longer just a video game streaming platform; it now hosts a variety of different types of content. We'll get into all of the amazing stuff you can live stream later, but for now, keep in mind that different types of content can necessitate the use of different equipment. This isn't the only reason to start with a content strategy, and we'll go over that more later, but it's worth mentioning because of the practical implications. 
					<br><br>
					<img src="twitchguide1.jpg" style="width: 80%; height: 220;">
					<br><br>
					It's likely that you're interested in watching games being streamed. If you're not interested in games, most desktop applications can be streamed using the same method: <br><br>
					1. In OBS, go to the sources panel and click the + button. Choose ‘Game Capture' and in the ‘Create New' area, type the name of the game or application you want to stream.<br><br>
					2. Pick ‘Capture Specific Window' from the game or program menu. Select OK.
					<br><br>
					3. From the Window drop-down menu, choose your submission. Select OK.
					</p>

				<li class="title"> Make a HUD</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Make sure that your stream looks good and stands out of the crowd. Put a border around where your webcam is and make sure that you have a pop-up notification when someone followers or donates. This will encourage other viewers to do the same.</p>

				<li class="title">Monetization</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Enabling monetization (onboarding) allows you to create products to use in your Extension. During monetization onboarding, we require your tax and financial information, so we can validate your identity and pay out any revenue you earn. According the their article, twitch Partners can earn revenue by accepting subscriptions from their viewers. The subscription options are: $4.99, $9.99, $24.99, or the Prime Gaming free subscription. Partners can also unlock up to 50 channel emotes.</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 200px; font-family: playfair display">Tips for Twitch Streaming </h1>
			<img src="twitchads7.png" class="imagesAds">
		<p class="intro-business">

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				<li class="title">Invest in a Good Twitch Layout</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Spending the time and effort to design a quality graphical layout for your stream will attract more viewers to it in the Twitch search results and will also communicate a sense or dedication and professionalism to those watching. A good layout should include a webcam in the upper left or right corner, a chat box for those watching in fullscreen, and your social media usernames either in a list or rotating slideshow.</p>

				<li class="title">Be Strategic With Your Games</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">When choosing a video game to stream, you need to be strategic if you want to attract viewers. Playing an old or unpopular game will likely result in no one watching while playing one of the most popular ones could leave you competing for attention against a hundred or so other streamers. For best results, browse Twitch and looks for games that have between 10 and 20 streamers streaming.</p>


				<li class="title">Stream a lot</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;"> Implement a Standing By or countdown screen which you can stream for around 30 minutes before you actually begin playing your game and/or turn your webcam on. This can attract viewers to your stream while you get things ready behind the scenes and will result in an attentive audience right from the get-go.</p>

				<li class="title">Donations</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Twitch users enjoy cheering on their favorite streamers. Donating money to their favorite streamers is one of the most popular ways they do this. Add a "donate" button to your channel, either via PayPal or a third-party app like Streamlabs, and let viewers see the money.</p>

				<li class="title">Brand Partnerships</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Companies use Twitch streamers to get their products in front of people, and the streamers get a kickback in return. This is typically referred to as a partner or affiliate relationship. Brands can sell hardware and software, energy drinks and accessories, such as headsets and chairs. Talk with other streamers for affiliate opportunities.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 200px; font-family: Suranna">Pros of Twitch Streaming</h2>
		
		<p class="intro-business">
			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				<li class="title">Earn Money</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;"> Subscriptions and bit cheers are unlocked once you reach affiliate status. Subscriptions are a subscription fee that people pay to help a particular streamer in exchange for some benefits. Twitch's currency is bits, which can be bought for about $1.40 USD per 100 bits. Additionally, Paypal tipping is a fantastic way for your viewers to help your stream.</p>
				
				<li class="title">Requires Little Resources</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;"> Live streaming, contrary to popular opinion, is very affordable. You don't need any special hardware or apps to start streaming 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you do have a smartphone or laptop with a decent camera and an active account with a streaming service such as twitch.</p>

				<li class="title">Make a Living by Following Your Dreams</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">You do not have to search for a 9-to-5 job or get stuck in one if you are already working. Live streaming offers you a chance to pursue your passion without having to be constantly stressed. As a successful streamer, you can exceed the income that you will probably make in most large corporates.</p>

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				
				<li class="title">There isn't any room for errors</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Live streamers often make mistakes because they produce content while broadcasting it instantaneously. To be successful and maintain an excellent reputation, it is vital for you to be well-prepared. As you gain the experience of full-time streaming, you will get better at it.</p>

				<li class="title">Technological Failures</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Internet access is critical for continuous streaming. Hardwired cable connection is preferred because it is not prone to regular interruptions. Your computer or phone may reboot during a live stream. Use multiple devices to ensure that your stream is not interrupted when one fails.</p>

				<li class="title">The Practice is Live</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Internet access is critical for continuous streaming. Hardwired cable connection is preferred because it is not prone to regular interruptions. Your computer or phone may reboot during a live stream. Use multiple devices to ensure that your stream is not interrupted when one fails.
					<br><br>
					* For businesses, another downside to live streaming is that it is the only way to change. It's important to remember that errors are unavoidable. There are, however, a few things you can do to cut down on mistakes.
					You and your team should start by practicing as much as possible and recording a dry run. You and your team should start by practicing as much as possible and recording a dry run. You'll be able to review your video and see what needs to be improved as a result.
					<br><br>
					* Second, you should evaluate your efforts after each time you go live to see where you can improve. Many viewers leave feedback in the comment section, which is taken into consideration.
					* Finally, you should plan for mistakes. Make contingency plans for anything that might go wrong so you'll know what to do if they do.
