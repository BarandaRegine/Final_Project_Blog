	</div>
	<img src="dropshipping2.jpeg" class="photo">
	<p class="intro">Dropshipping is a method where you sell products from a third party store then has it shipped directly to your customer. It is actually a convenient way to sell products online because with drop shipping, you donâ€™t need to invest with your stocks or have your own inventory. It simply means that you gotta earn your money just by posting different items from your chosen third party supplier. It permits you to enter a market with small chance of risk and lower capital investment as you do not have to order stock until after a client orders it from you.Drop shipping is the business that gives opportunity to everybody. You can consider this business no matter where you came from or what place of the world you are located. If you want to set up a business online that will let you earn money by selling at any part of the globe, then drop shipping would be the perfect one for you.

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				<li class="title">Select a niche</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">The niche you select needs to be laser-focused and something you are genuinely interested in. Low shipping costs are very important. Products should trigger impulse buys and appeal to those with the financial ability to make a purchase on the spot. Sell something that isn't readily available locally. Create your own brand. Your drop shipping business will have more value if you can rebrand whatever it is you are selling and pass it off as your own.</p>
					

				<li class="title">Perform Competition Research</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">You will be competing with other drop shipping operations as well as retail giants such as Walmart and Amazon. Look for products that have competition, as it's a sign that there is a high demand and the business model is sustainable.</p>

					

				<li class="title">Secure a supplier</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Most drop shipping suppliers are located overseas, making communication extremely important. Alibaba.com is one of the largest online resources to identify and communicate with potential manufacturers and suppliers. There are plenty of information sources available to help you avoid costly supplier mistakes.</p>
					
				<li class="title">Build your ecommerce website </li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;"> The fastest way to launch a website that supports a drop shipping business model is to use Shopify. You don't need a tech background to get up and running with Shopify, and it has plenty of apps to help increase sales. Even if you have a sizable budget, it's a much wiser move to use one of the plug-and-play options.</p>
					
				<li class="title">Create a strategy that would secure your clients </li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">The fastest way to launch a website that supports a drop shipping business model is to use a simple ecommerce platform such as Shopify. Having a great product and a website is great, but without customers looking to buy, you don't have a business. There are several ways to attract potential customers, but the most effective option is to start a Facebook ad campaign. It's an easy way to leverage your existing customer base and generate revenue without additional advertising and marketing spend. It gives you the ability to compete with the largest brands and retailers immediately. You also have to think long term, so search engine optimization and email marketing should also be a focus.</p>
				
				<li class="title">Analyze and optimize</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">You need to track all of the data and metrics available to grow your business. This includes Google Analytics traffic and Facebook conversion pixel data. You will never have a set-and-forget advertising or marketing solution. You need to constantly test new opportunities and fine-tune current campaigns. </p>

		<h1 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 200px; font-family: playfair display">Tips for Starting Your Dropshipping Business </h1>
			<img src="dropshipads.png" class="imagesAds">
		<p class="intro-business">

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
				<li class="title">Do not focus on working with the price </li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Dropshippers usually focus on looking for an item that has a lower price for them to sell it higher. But is it the only thing you need to do? No. Remember that whatâ€™s important is to justify the price that you are offering your customers. You can still sell those high selling items and offer them with packaged deals, free shipping or other strategies without having to lose your sale. </p>

				<li class="title">Find a suitable product you can sell</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Looking for the perfect product you know you can market and unique in the eyes of your customers is one of the sustainable strategies you can do as you have the product knowledge and expertise for it. </p>
					
				<li class="title">Try Different Marketplaces </li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">Multichannel merchants are usually the most successful dropshipping merchants. Different marketplace attracts different types of customers that is why you also need to perform a different marketing strategy that applies to each one of them. You can also modify your pricing strategy depending on the platform you are publishing your product. </p>
					
				<li class="title">Provide a quality customer service</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">The customer service you offer your customers is one of the things you can take advantage of compared to the different sellers online. Being responsive to your customerâ€™s concerns and inquiries, updating them to the process of their order and addressing their concerns is the key to gain their trust and make your store a reliable one. </p>
					
				<li class="title">Optimize Product Descriptions</li><br>
					<p class="intro-business" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 380px;">The quality of your product listings will get the attention of your customers that is why it is important to make them appealing for them.  You can also create your own unique product photos to make them stand out from the marketplace </p>
